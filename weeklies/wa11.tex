\section{Preparation for Assignment}
If, and \textit{only if} you can truthfully assert the truthfulness of each statement below are you ready to start the exercises.
\subsection {Reading Comprehension Self-Check}
\begin{itemize}
\item  I know in what sense the power of algorithms is limited.
\item  I know that lower bounds $\Omega$ to many problems are known, i.e., no
    algorithm can undercut them.
\item  I can give at least two examples of problems with known lower bounds.
\item  I know that some problems cannot be fully solved.
\item  I know that there are problems for which algorithms are \textbf{not known} to
    exist.
\item  I know that there are problems for which algorithms are \textbf{known not} to
    exist.
\item  I know that many problems are considered intractable, which means
    infeasible to solve with current technology.
\item  I know that numerical algorithms face the limiting effects of
    truncation, roundoff, overflow, underflow and cancellation.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Memory Self-Check}
I can, and have, explained to someone who is not a student in the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering or Computer Information Technology departments the difference between problems that are \textit{P} and \textit{NP} so that these persons actually understand the difference.
